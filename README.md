- Start with 15 missiles and face your first fleet. Each fleet is randomly generated with 5 ships.
- Destroy as many ships as you can, earning money to spend in the warehouse.
- Once you run out of missiles, your run is over.
- After each run, you can spend your cash in the warehouse for items. These items will allow you to progress further and achieve a higher score.
- After each stage, the board grows bigger, and there is a chance for larger fleets.
- Try to get the highest score you can!
